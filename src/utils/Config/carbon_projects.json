      "about": "The North Pikounda REDD+ Project is designed to protect 92,530 hectares of unlogged native Congolese forest, legally designated as a selective logging concession. The anticipated selective logging would have been undertaken on the dry lands, consisting of an area of 55,950 ha. The main activity of the North Pikounda REDD+ Project is the cancelation of the planned degradation and deforestation activities and the decision to instead protect the forest area, while maintaining and protecting the biodiversity of the area.",

The proposed 100.8 MW wind power project is also known as Project Sky. The project activity uses Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) manufactured by General Electric (GE). The project activity generates electricity using wind potential and converts it into kinetic energy using Wind turbines, which drives the alternators to generate energy. The generated electricity is exported to the regional grid system.",
